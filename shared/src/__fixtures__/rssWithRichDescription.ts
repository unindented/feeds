      <title>Demystifying monads in Rust through property-based testing</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="sectioned-post"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming pedagogy, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29"&gt;monads&lt;/a&gt; have a place as a mystical object from the functional programming world that&amp;rsquo;s hard to understand and even harder to explain. The stereotype about monad explanations is that they fall into two buckets: either comparisons to some kind of &lt;a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html"&gt;food item&lt;/a&gt;, or throwing complex mathematical jargon at you, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem"&gt;&lt;em&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But monads aren&amp;rsquo;t esoteric or magical at all, nor do they only occur in functional programming. In essence, a monad is a &lt;em&gt;design pattern&lt;/em&gt; that allows you to chain together operations within a framework. Noticing monadic design can be quite helpful for programmers in any environment, particularly because it&amp;rsquo;s often &lt;strong&gt;undesirable&lt;/strong&gt;! In many situations, monads have observable tradeoffs, and sometimes (as here) we can even collect concrete data to back this up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Free will quite clearly doesn't exist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no brand-new insight in this post. A huge amount of credit goes to various philosophers and thinkers, especially folks like &lt;a href="https://www.voidpod.com/"&gt;Aaron Rabinowitz&lt;/a&gt;, for shaping my views. Any errors in it are my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the natural world, everything that occurs is the result of a chain of causation all the way to the big bang. The chain of causation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost entirely deterministic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with some chaotic effects that appear to be random on the outside but in reality are deterministic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and also with a small amount of true (quantum) randomness, that very occasionally turns into something big&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We&amp;rsquo;ll summarize all of these causes into a single word, &amp;ldquo;deterministic.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
